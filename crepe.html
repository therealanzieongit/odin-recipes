    <h3>Crepes are simple to make</h3>
    <p>Making homemade crêpes is <strong>easier than you think</strong>. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Here are the ingredients you'll need.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add flour and melted butter; whisk vigorously until batter is smooth and pourable.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
